# Dungeon of The Mad Rat
## About
This project is a way to test and refresh my skills as a game developer. I graduated in this field in 2018, but I haven't worked with Unity or on any game projects since then. In the meantime, I have been working as a C# developer for a company, and now I'm eager to return to game development.

## Game Principles
In this game, I aim to create a small roguelike, inspired by games like ***Vampire Survivors***. 
The game will feature a few weapons and upgrades, along with a handful of enemies.
